This is another way of tracking users online: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon

# Web beacon
A web beacon (also called web bug, tracking bug, tag, web tag, page tag, tracking pixel, pixel tag, 1Ã—1 GIF, or clear GIF) is one of various techniques used on 
web pages and email, to unobtrusively (usually invisibly) allow checking that a user has accessed some content.
It basically consists of an image or other resource sent in email, that is downloaded from the server it's hosted on when you open the email. This allows 
the server to know your IP address, cookies, user agent string, and your browser fingerprint the image may be as small as one pixel (invisible) as stated 
in the wiki article. It may even be the embedded image of the company logo!

This is why protonmail doesn't automatically load "external content" (images usually)
(a more secure alternative to gmail)

For those who are more technically inclined, there are ways of routing your whole system's traffic through tor. 
This can be done using iptables, proxychains, and some edits to your torrc files. Here are some links I've found:
